What's up guys, we're here in CancunÂ 
and in this video we're going to showÂ Â  you the best things to do in and around the area.Â Â  So there's beautiful cenotes, ancient ruins,Â 
and of course some really beautiful beaches too,Â Â  and we found a secret spot which we can'tÂ 
wait to show you. So enjoy this video! We are Zac and Ine. Full-time digitalÂ 
nomads from the United States and Belgium.Â Â  We met while studying abroad in 2018 and haveÂ 
been traveling the world together ever since.Â Â  We're here to inspire your next adventure,Â 
whether it's hiking in the Canadian Rockies,Â Â  a road trip through the US, or backpackingÂ 
across Africa. On our channel, you'll findÂ Â  unfiltered videos of hiking guides and the bestÂ 
things to do in destinations around the world. Located in the northeast of the YucatanÂ 
Peninsula, Cancun borders the Caribbean Sea.Â Â  It's known for its white sand beaches,Â 
turquoise sea, numerous resorts, andÂ Â  nightlife. The city is composed of two distinctÂ 
areas: the more local downtown area, El Centro,Â Â  and Zona Hotelera, a long beachfront stripÂ 
of high-rise hotels, nightclubs, shops,Â Â  and restaurants. Cancun is known around the worldÂ 
as the party capital of Mexico, with great air andÂ Â  ground transportation connectivity. But there'sÂ 
so many more things to do in Cancun besides justÂ Â  the nightlife. In this video, we'll show youÂ 
the top 10 things to do in and around Cancun. The Cancun Scenic Tower is the highest attractionÂ 
in the Riviera Maya. Here, you can take a ride upÂ Â  to an altitude of 262 feet or 80 meters.Â 
You can take photos while the deck spinsÂ Â  giving you 360 degree views of the entire HotelÂ 
Zone. You can also learn a bit about the historyÂ Â  of Cancun through the audio commentary. The totalÂ 
viewpoint experience lasts about 15 to 20 minutes. The ninth best thing to do in Cancun is to visitÂ 
the downtown area. Downtown Cancun offers a greatÂ Â  taste of local culture, with deliciousÂ 
street food, small shops, and cute parks.Â Â  This is the area where the locals liveÂ 
and this is visible in the prices as well.Â Â  You'll find more affordable souvenir shops andÂ 
eateries here than in the Hotel Zone, with pricesÂ Â  being sometimes three times cheaper. Wander downÂ 
Avenida Tulum and experience the real Cancun. At number eight we have a trulyÂ 
refreshing and unique experience:Â Â  swimming in the nearby cenotes.Â 
The Yucatan Peninsula in generalÂ Â  is well known for its cenotes, with as many asÂ 
six thousand of them scattered around the area.Â Â  Our favorite cenotes near Cancun include theÂ 
Cenote Azul, Gran Cenote, Sac Actun, and CalaveraÂ Â  Cenote. But, if you're looking for ones that areÂ 
closer, head to the Ruta de los Cenotes. It's bestÂ Â  to rent a car for the day if you want to visit aÂ 
few of them as most cenotes are in the middle ofÂ Â  nowhere. However, many day tours also combineÂ 
at least one cenote with other attractions. Yeah it's very cool likeÂ 
we're in a little cave here,Â Â  but you can also do a lot of reallyÂ 
cool jumps from like the rocks above us. The Hotel Zone is the primary touristÂ 
area filled with high-rise hotels,Â Â  shops, bars, and many restaurants. It's a 15Â 
mile wide or 24 kilometer strip of beautifulÂ Â  white-sand beaches and deep blue water andÂ 
thus it's where most people decide to stay.Â Â  However, it can also getÂ 
very crowded and expensive.Â Â  There's only one road, the Kukulcan Boulevard,Â 
which runs from one side to the other. Playa ChacÂ Â  Mool is gorgeous, but it's very wavy. It's alsoÂ 
a great place to print water sports equipment. As briefly explained at the start of thisÂ 
video, Cancun is the party capital of MexicoÂ Â  and so we can't talk about the cityÂ 
without mentioning the nightlife.Â Â  Most nightclubs are located in theÂ 
Hotel Zone and can get pretty wild.Â Â  Coco Bongo is the most popular club in Cancun,Â 
featuring acrobats, cover bands, and DJs.Â Â  But, there are many other clubs such as SeÃ±orÂ 
Frogs, Mandala Beach Club, and the City Nightclub.Â Â  All of them offer something differentÂ 
but can have long wait lines. Located along a more quiet part of the Hotel Zone,Â 
Playa Tortugas is our favorite beach in the zone.Â Â  It has public access and offers a more localÂ 
experience with a relaxed atmosphere and cleanÂ Â  sands. It's also better for swimming as the waterÂ 
is calm and there's generally less wind here.Â Â  Therefore, it's ideal for families with kids.Â Â  This beach also boasts several open-airÂ 
restaurants with seafood dishes and drinks. So besides relaxing or renting a jetÂ 
ski at Playa Tortugas, you can alsoÂ Â  bungee jump if you're looking for some adrenaline.Â 
So there's a guy about to jump right now. The fourth best thing to do in Cancun is toÂ 
go on a day trip to the nearby Isla Mujeres.Â Â  Only a 20 minute boat ride from Cancun, IslaÂ 
Mujeres is a peaceful paradise known for itsÂ Â  white-sand beaches, crystal clear waters, and theÂ 
friendliest locals in the Mexican Caribbean. TheÂ Â  island is small so you can get around it easilyÂ 
by golf cart or bike. Make sure to watch theÂ Â  sea turtles at the local turtle farm, visit theÂ 
Mayan ruins and cliffs at Punta Sur, and watch theÂ Â  sunset at Playa Norte. Find more details about aÂ 
day tour to Isla Mujeres in the description below. About 12 and a half miles or 20 kilometers northÂ 
of the city of Cancun sits the stunning IslaÂ Â  Blanca. You can get here by local colectivo, whichÂ 
leaves near the "Farmacia Canto" at the cornerÂ Â  of Avenida Lopez Portillo and Calle 7, aboutÂ 
three times a day. We got off at the last stopÂ Â  which is the thinnest part of the peninsula.Â 
This untouched peninsula is a true hidden gem,Â Â  with the turquoise Caribbean sea on one side andÂ 
an immense laguna with kiteboarders on the other.Â Â  You feel a thousand miles away fromÂ 
the hustle and bustle of Cancun. So we're walking the beaches of Isla BlancaÂ 
here and it's so peaceful compared to theÂ Â  rest of Cancun. It's really a hiddenÂ 
gem. One thing you should do thoughÂ Â  is make sure you bring your own food andÂ 
drinks, because there's literally nothingÂ Â  out here. And you're kind of on your own.Â 
But it's really peaceful, you should come A trip to Cancun isn't complete withoutÂ 
visiting one of the 7 World Wonders.Â Â  ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡ is located about three hours awayÂ 
from Cancun by car or tour bus. It was once aÂ Â  vibrant city with a diverse population of MayanÂ 
people extending well into the tens of thousands.Â Â  Today, it's one of the most visitedÂ 
archaeological sites in all of Mexico.Â Â  The "El Castillo Pyramid" in the site centerÂ 
is the most iconic and spectacular MayanÂ Â  ruin of the entire archaeological site.Â 
Find a link in the description below toÂ Â  book your own ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡ day tour, whichÂ 
combines the ruins with a beautiful cenote. The best thing to do in Cancun in our opinionÂ 
is to go scuba diving or snorkeling at the MUSAÂ Â  Underwater Museum of Art as well as the ManchonesÂ 
Reef. Located only 30 minutes away from Cancun,Â Â  this underwater museum is home to 500 life-sizeÂ 
sculptures that are used to promote coral, algae,Â Â  and other marine life. It's arguably the largestÂ 
museum of its kind anywhere on earth. But besidesÂ Â  this museum, there's also a beautiful reef nearby.Â 
The Manchones Reef is home to various types ofÂ Â  fish, sea turtles, and rays. Find more info aboutÂ 
a dive and snorkel tour in the description below. All right guys, that's it for our video on theÂ 
best things to do in Cancun. We really hope youÂ Â  enjoyed it. Make sure to check out our other videoÂ
